to run, you'll need a .env file with the following:

DISCORD_TOKEN=
CHANNEL_ID= // discord channel ID
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME= // just the name of your google sheet
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON= // needs to be escaped
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=

run a pip install and python3 discordAlbumBot.py will get you up and running! :)
